/* 
	Purpose is to set background ROYGBIV rainbow. Of course, we wouldn't be as outlandish on a real webpage. Maybe apply to a smaller element that needs dressing up. (eg. background to png img).
	Or use similar colors such as navy blue and black. 
	The loud and garrulous colors are used here to make the example noticable.
