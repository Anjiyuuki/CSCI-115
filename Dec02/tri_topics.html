        <h2>Read Me Because You Can</h2>
        <p>We will use this webpage to get some exposure and hands on for
          animation, tables, and forms. As for animation, moving objects can be
          useful to grab the audience's attention in a websites, especially when
          used effectively.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The first animation example is an outlandish display of background
            colors for the body. I wanted to make the changes very evident.
            Remember that in actual websites you would want to be subtle.
          </li>
          <li>The second animation also creates a greater spectacle than you would
            use on a website. A more subtle variation might be to move within a
            smaller amount of space.
          </li>
          <li>The third example is pretty cool, in my opinion. It spins and
            transforms a picture when hovered over.
          </li>
          <li>In the fourth example, the picture is reduced when the mouse hovers
            over it. The transition is smooth.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Next, we will create a simple table. Tables are covered and Chapter
          12, and although it would be nice to learn more, I feel the this quick
          hands on exercise will be enough demystify it.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, we'll create a quick little HTML form. Generally, a form is
          used for the user to submit information. In this course, however, we
          only cover the front end part of it and will not have any info
          processing.
